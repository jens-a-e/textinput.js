# Input.js - Get Text from files and clipboard

**Bugs might still occur, especially on build!**

## Dependecies

* jQuery 1.6.x

For building and development you also need:

* node.js for the following  -- nodejs.org
* coffee script -- http://coffeescript.org
* uglifyjs -- https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS


## How to build

`cd` into the directory and issue

	./builder.sh

It creates a build directory with a combined and uglifyd version


## How to use

See index.html for uncombined use and build-test.html for compiled use. Also see `js/script.js` for script initialisation. Open in the broswer and follow instructions :) Watch you favorite webconsole for output.
